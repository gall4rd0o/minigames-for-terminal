# Some problems that I have noticed

1. Idk how to explain this: when keys are pressed, are saved in a kind of buffer(??) and when the game ends the keys are written in console.
2. When the board dimensions are bigger than the terminal dimensions, the board is not printed correctly.

# Next changes to be made

1. Change the colors of the numbers according to the original game
2. Change the way to play again
3. Create a way to save the game 
4. Create predefined difficulties (easy, medium, hard, etc) and others configurations
